# Spam Filtration with UCI Spambase Dataset

This project aims to develop a spam filter using the [UCI Spambase dataset] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/94/spambase) within the scope of a machine learning course. The project is implemented using the Python programming language and various libraries in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Content
- `spambase.csv`: UCI Spambase dataset.
- `spambase.names`: Contains the features of the UCI Spambase dataset.
- `spambase.DOCUMENTATION`: Documentation of the UCI Spambase dataset.
- `SpamFilterML.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file. It includes steps such as exploring the dataset, splitting into training/test sets, and creating models using K-NN, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks algorithms.
